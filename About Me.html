    <h2>Personal</h2>
    <p>Hi, my full name is Jordan Orion Briggs. I was born on March 17th, 2008, somewhere around 8 in the morning.
    I was born in Oregon Portland, United States of America. I am 6' tall (182.88 cm).</p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>As every other Human, I have a few hobbies. Not sure if Aliens have hobbies too, though they probably do.
    Anyways, one of my favorite hobbies is Web Development. Yes, I know I said I'm new to it, but that doesn't
    mean I can't enjoy it. I only know Html and some CSS, and do not know JavaScript as I am not interested.
    A few other hobbies that I have are speaking in Morse Code, (There'll be a page about that), playing Video
    Games, I really like pissing people off with Morse (They get pissed off cause they don't understand it).
    I also like to play the PIano, as well as workout. Oh, and I only know one language which is American English,
    besides Morse Code.</p>
